Welcome to use the binary release of ZENO! To play with it, simply extract the `.tar.gz` and run `./start.sh` in it, the node editor window will shows up if everything works.

There are some example graphs in the `./arts/` folder, you may open them in the editor and have fun!
Currently `rigid3.zsg`, `FLIPSolver.zsg`, `prim.zsg`, and `lennardjones.zsg` are confirmed to be functional.
Hint: To run an animation for 100 frames, change the `1` on the top-left of node editor to `100`, then click `Execute`.
Also MMB to drag in the node editor, LMB click on sockets to create connections. MMB drag in the viewport to orbit camera, Shift+MMB to pan camera.

If you find the binary version didn't worked properly or some error message has been thrown on your machine, please let me know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/zenustech/zeno/issues) on GitHub, thanks for you support!
